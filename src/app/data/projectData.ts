        description: `As one of three core developers, I contributed to the maintenance and modernization of an internal application used by energy providers. I played a key role in transforming legacy WinForms and C# systems into scalable Angular 15 web solutions. This included leading the transition from a desktop-based architecture to a dynamic web platform, integrating multiple data sources to provide real-time, reliable information. I developed admin tools and customer-facing features to enhance operational efficiency and transparency. To support team growth, I created a comprehensive Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for faster onboarding and authored a learnerâ€™s guide to help C# developers transition smoothly into Angular development.`
